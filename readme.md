This is a fangame based on the popular web novel [Worth The Candle](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25137/worth-the-candle) by Alexander Wales.

The latest playable version can be found on [Itch.io](https://maddoscientisto.itch.io/worth-the-candle-gb?secret=9BtqXLzHUtxmusw0Gcoi4ntNHE).

This game is made with [GB Studio 3.1.0](https://www.gbstudio.dev/).

This repository can't be compiled as is because the assets need to be on a private submodule, due to most of them being non-free.

This repository lacks a license on purpose, since I don't own Worth The Candle I can't allow commercial use of any kind.
